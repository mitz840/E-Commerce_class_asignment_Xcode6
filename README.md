# E-Commerce_class_asignment_Xcode6
This is a class assignment, so it offers basic UI and limited functionality. 
It's a simple application to show the basic functionality of an e-commerce application. 
The user can view products, add them to cart or delete it from the cart. It also distinguishes between admin and user.
An admin can add/edit/delete a new or existing product in the database. 
To access admin privilege register a new user and pick the username as "Mitz" (case insensitive) and password as "admin" and email as "admin".
